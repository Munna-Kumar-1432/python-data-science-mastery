# Python Programming & Data Analysis Project by Munna Kumar

Welcome! I am **Munna Kumar**, and this is my dedicated space for mastering Python and Data Science. This repository is a curated collection of my coding journey, featuring hands-on projects, structured learning modules, and deep dives into Python's most powerful libraries. It serves as a comprehensive log of my technical growth and a showcase of practical solutions in the world of programming.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into several key modules, covering everything from core language fundamentals to advanced data visualization.

### 1. [Python Fundamentals](./Python/)
Includes essentials of Python programming:
- Overview & Basics: Introduction to the environment and basic syntax.
- Data Types: Understanding strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- String Methods: Practical exercises on manipulating text.
- List & Tuple Operations: Detailed methods for handling collection types.
- File Handling: (Coming Soon) Reading and writing files.

### 2. [Numerical Python (Numpy)](./Numpy/)
Detailed notes and exercises on `Numpy`, the core library for numerical computations, array processing, and mathematical functions.

### 3. [Data Manipulation (Pandas)](./Pandas/)
Focuses on the `Pandas` library for data cleaning, transformation, and structured analysis.
- Introduction to Series and DataFrames.
- Real-world case studies (e.g., Car Pricing Analysis).

### 4. [Data Visualization (Matplotlib)](./Matplotlib/)
Visual representations of data using graphs, plots, and charts.
